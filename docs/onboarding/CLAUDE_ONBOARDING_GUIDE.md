CLAUDE_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md

Last updated: 2025-10-07

🧭 Purpose

This guide explains how to initialize and operate the Claude Documentation & Research Agent inside the Downtime ecosystem.
Claude’s role is to maintain /docs/context as a living source of truth for Codex and GPT-5 while performing continuous technical and market research.

⚙️ Setup Overview

Required Files in Repository

CLAUDE_SYSTEM_CONTEXT_PROMPT_v2.md → defines Claude’s scope and behavior

codex_safety_prompt_block.md → defines Codex safety and branching rules

roadmap.md and task_log.md → current operational context

all Knowledge Base PDFs and Specs → input data for context regeneration

🧩 Initialization Steps

Prepare Environment

Ensure all reference documents (Knowledge Bases, Specs, Recommendations) exist locally or in Claude’s accessible workspace.

Confirm Git is initialized and .gitignore excludes large raw datasets.

Run First Claude Session

Open Claude in a new project chat.

Paste the full contents of CLAUDE_SYSTEM_CONTEXT_PROMPT_v2.md.

When asked, provide access or upload all reference docs listed under “Documents to Ingest.”

Claude will:

Create /docs/context/ and /docs/research/ folders.

Generate four key files:
System_Context.md, File_Responsibility_Map.md, Research_Proposals_YYYYMMDD.md, Change_Log.md.

Commit Outputs

Review the generated files.

Commit them to a new branch (example: claude/context-v1).

PR to develop or main after GPT-5 review.

Tag commit with the date and version: v-context-1.0.

Sync With Codex

Codex reads /docs/context to understand architecture and logic.

Each time Claude regenerates context, Codex automatically references the _Last synced: header for versioning.

Weekly or Milestone Regeneration

Trigger Claude again after major PR merges or strategic shifts.

Claude regenerates the entire /docs/context folder (full rebuild).

Commit as v-context-X.X.

Research Integration

Each regeneration produces new /docs/research/Research_Proposals_YYYYMMDD.md.

Review proposals with GPT-5 to decide which insights to act on.

Codex implements approved ideas via new branches.

🔒 Operational Rules

Claude has read/write access only to /docs/context and /docs/research.

Codex has write access to codebase (but never main).

GPT-5 oversees all merges and long-term direction.

Each regeneration must include a _Last synced: timestamp in top headers.

⚡ Quick Reference Commands

(assuming your repo uses simple script shortcuts)

# Run local context regeneration (manual trigger)
npm run claude:sync

# Review new context before commit
git diff docs/context/

# Tag and push
git commit -m "Claude context regen v1.0"
git tag v-context-1.0
git push origin HEAD --tags


(These can later be wired into automation once your agent orchestration pipeline is live.)

🧱 Future Integrations

Debugging Agent → Monitors build logs and routes new error traces to /docs/context/errors/

Token Efficiency Tracker → Adds compression logs once token-cost auditing is needed

Claude-GPT Bridge → Enables automated question routing between agents for context-aware task requests
