## v1.1 ‚Äî 2025-10-07 (Cache TTL Update)

### Summary
Major architectural update based on Chief of Staff feedback. Extended cache TTL from 15 minutes to 7 days to align with cost-first strategy and minimize API costs during growth phase. Re-prioritized research proposals based on new caching model.

### Critical Change: Cache TTL Policy

**Previous (v1.0)**:
- Cache TTL: 15 minutes
- Rationale: "Fast test" version, prioritized freshest possible data
- Cache hit rate: ~50-60%

**New (v1.1)**:
- Cache TTL: **7 days (168 hours)**
- Rationale: Static data (parks, businesses) rarely changes; align with cost-first strategy
- Projected cache hit rate: **85-90%**

**Impact**:
- Reduces redundant API calls by ~85% (vs ~50% with 15-minute cache)
- Keeps costs predictable: $365-385/month at 1,000 DAU (within $400 budget)
- Better for free-first providers (OSM, Foursquare)

### Documents Updated

#### 1. **System_Context.md (v1.1)**
**Major Changes**:
- Cache TTL updated throughout (15 min ‚Üí 7 days)
- Cost projections recalculated (now $365-385/month at 1,000 DAU)
- Cache hit rate projection updated (85-90%)
- Added "Future Enhancement" section for weekly grid refresh (after 500 DAU)

**Sections Modified**:
- `/modules/supabase.ts` ‚Üí Complete rewrite of cache functions
- Database Schema ‚Üí `cached_places` table updated with new expiry default
- Critical Rules ‚Üí Updated cache-first rule with 7-day context

#### 3. **Research_Proposals_20251007.md (v1.1)**
**Major Changes**:
- **Predictive Cache Warming** downgraded from P0 to P3
  - Reframed as "Weekly Grid Refresh System"
  - No longer urgent with 7-day cache
  - Replaced aggressive pre-warming with weekly refresh for top grids only
- **Real-Time Hours Verification** clarified as P1 (after 500 DAU)
  - Added context about 7-day cache making hours accuracy more critical
  - Emphasized crowdsourced validation model
- **Competitive Intelligence** elevated to P1 with "extremely valuable" designation
  - Added monthly monitoring cadence
  - Suggested assigning to recurring Claude Research task
- **Small Business Tools** focused on MVP subset
  - Prioritize Flyer Generator + Attribution Dashboard

- Proposal #3 (Hours Verification) ‚Üí Added 7-day cache context
- Proposal #4 (Small Business Tools) ‚Üí Narrowed to MVP focus
- Priority Summary table ‚Üí Complete reorganization

#### 4. **Change_Log.md (v1.1)** ‚Üê This document
**Major Changes**:
- Added v1.1 section documenting all cache TTL changes
- Summarized Chief of Staff feedback and actions taken
- Updated version control guidelines

### Structural Decisions

**Why 7 Days?**:
1. Parks, landmarks, and established businesses rarely change within a week
2. Aligns with cost-first principle (minimize paid API usage until monetized)
3. Reduces database load and API rate limit concerns
4. Still fresh enough for user trust (<5% false positive target)
5. Weekly refresh for high-traffic grids can supplement if needed

**Future Considerations**:
- Monitor actual false positive rate at 7 days (target: <5%)
- Implement user reporting for closed/changed venues
- Add weekly refresh for top 50 grids after 500 DAU
- Consider category-specific TTLs (e.g., 3 days for restaurants, 14 days for parks)

### Implementation Checklist

**Code Changes Required**:
- [ ] Update `supabase.ts` ‚Üí Change `expires_at` default to `+ interval '7 days'`
- [ ] Update cache lookup logic ‚Üí Check `expires_at > now()` instead of 15-minute calculation
- [ ] Update `putCachedPlaces()` ‚Üí Set expiry to 7 days from creation
- [ ] Add `cache_age` field to API response (hours since cache creation)
- [ ] Update frontend to display cache freshness indicator (optional)

**Documentation Updates**:
- [x] System_Context.md updated to v1.1
- [x] File_Responsibility_Map.md updated to v1.1
- [x] Research_Proposals updated to v1.1
- [x] Change_Log.md updated to v1.1

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Verify cache expiry logic works correctly (7 days from creation)
- [ ] Load test with 1,000 simulated users
- [ ] Measure cache hit rate (target: 85%+)
- [ ] Monitor API costs for 1 week
- [ ] Track false positive rate (user reports)

### Chief of Staff Feedback Summary

**Approved Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Cache TTL: 15 minutes ‚Üí 7 days
- ‚úÖ Research priorities reordered based on 7-day cache model
- ‚úÖ Small Business Tools narrowed to MVP focus (Flyer + Attribution)
- ‚úÖ Competitive Intelligence elevated to ongoing P1 task
- ‚úÖ Weekly grid refresh replaces aggressive predictive cache warming

**Rationale** (from Chief of Staff):
> "The 15-minute cache TTL made sense for an early 'fast test' version, but now that Downtime's cost-containment strategy is paramount, it should be dramatically lengthened. The 7-day policy reduces redundant API calls on static data (parks, cafes, landmarks rarely change) and aligns with your 'free-first providers' approach."

**Research Proposal Assessment**:
- **Multi-Provider Deduplication**: ‚úÖ High priority, fully aligned (P0)
- **Predictive Cache Warming**: ‚öôÔ∏è Good concept, but unnecessary short term (P3)
- **Real-Time Hours Verification**: üî• Keep on deck (P1 after 500 DAU)
- **Competitive Intelligence**: üíé Extremely valuable (P1 ongoing)
- **Small Business Tools**: üöÄ Perfect for revenue expansion (P2, MVP focus)
- **Retention Mechanics / OSM Expansion**: üß© Nice-to-haves (P3)

### Metrics to Track (v1.1)

**New Metrics** (added with cache update):
- Cache hit rate (target: 85-90%)
- Cache age at time of request (median, p95)
- API calls per DAU (target: <0.3 with 7-day cache)
- False positive rate (user reports) (target: <5%)

**Existing Metrics** (unchanged):
- DAU, WAU, MAU
- D1/D7/D30 return rate
- Session length, searches per session
- Monthly API costs, cost per user
